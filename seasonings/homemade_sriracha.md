## Homemade Sriracha

Sure, Huy Fong's “rooster” brand sriracha is great, but wouldn't be nice to make your own? Now you can.

A few notes before starting:

* Don't be a cowboy (or cowgirl)-use gloves. You are going to be handling a lot of peppers and the last thing you want to do is touch your eye (or a more _sensitive_) body part.
* Have good ventilation. Especially on the day you bring your chilis to a boil.


### Ingredients

* 1 pound red jalepeño pepper, stemmed, seeded and halved.
* ½ pound red serrano  pepper, stemmed, seeded and halved.
* ¼ pound red thai chiles, stemmed, and halved.
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled.
* 1 tablespoon kosher salt.
* 4 tablespoons palm sugar (brown sugar can be substituted, see notes).
* ½ cup cane vinegar (or rice wine vinegar, see notes).
