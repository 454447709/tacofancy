## Homemade Sriracha

Sure, Huy Fong's “rooster” brand sriracha is great, but wouldn't be nice to make your own? Now you can.

A few notes before starting:

* Don't be a cowboy (or cowgirl)-use gloves. You are going to be handling a lot of peppers and the last thing you want to do is touch your eye (or a more _sensitive_) body part.
* Have good ventilation. Especially on the day you bring your chilis to a boil.


### Ingredients

* 1 pound red jalepeño pepper, stemmed, seeded and halved.
* ½ pound red serrano  pepper, stemmed, seeded and halved.
* ¼ pound red thai chiles, stemmed, and halved.
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled.
* 1 tablespoon kosher salt.
* 4 tablespoons palm sugar (brown sugar can be substituted, see notes).
* ½ cup cane vinegar (or rice wine vinegar, see notes).

### Directions

1. Combine chilis, garlic, salt and sugar in food processor. Pulse to a coarse pureé.
2. Transfer pureé to glass container. Store at room temperature for one week, stirring daily (see notes).
3. After one week, transfer pureé to small saucepan, add vinegar and bring to boil. 
4. Reduce heat and simmer for five minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature.
5. Transfer pureé to food processor and process for two to three minutes.
6. Strain pureé through fine mesh strainer, using back of spoon or rubber spatula to press solids through strainer.
7. Transfer finished sauce to glass jars and refrigerate. Can be stored for up to 6 months.
