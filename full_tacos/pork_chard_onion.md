pulled pork, chard, and pickled onion tacos
===========================================

Tried this combination out tonight, and it turned out amazing.

You'll need the following taco objects:

* [pulled pork](/base_layers/crock_pot_pulled_pork.md)
* [swiss chard](/base_layers/swiss_chard.md)
* [pickled onions](/condiments/pickled_red_onions.md)

Combine these on a corn tortilla, add a dollop of sour cream and sriracha. Uh-mazing.
