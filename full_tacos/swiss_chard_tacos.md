# Swiss Chard Tacos

This is actually a Rick Bayless recipe from his cookbook _Mexican Everyday_, but we've used it a fair amount on those days we feel like not eating meat but still want to have tacos.

Components:
* 1 bunch swiss or rainbow chard. Could also do spinach I guess. Probably not good with kale.
* 1 onion sliced thin
* 1/2 cup of chicken broth
* crumbled queso fresco or crema
* salsa

Slice up the chard into small slices. In a large skillet, heat the oil on medium-high. Cook the onions until soft, plus some garlic and red pepper flakes if you want. Put the chard in the skillet, add the broth. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the greens are wilted and almost tender (about 5 minutes). Uncover, bring heat back to medium high and cook until almost dry. Salt as necessary. Enjoy.

One great thing about the Rick Bayless cookbook is that he suggests riffs on any recipe, which is the ethos of *taco fancy.* So, you could stir in shredded chick or steak once you've uncovered the pan. Or you could go more vegetarian (aka the "Mike Monteiro") and add tofu. Chard tacos might seem nuts, but they really are pretty good.
