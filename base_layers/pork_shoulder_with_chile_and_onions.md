### Pork Shoulder with Chile and Onions
This was my attempt to re-create my most favorite _al pastor_ in Oakland -- the stuff they make at Tacos Sinaloa in Fruitvale. Saucy, packed with sauteed onions -- it's amazing stuff. It's also not... well, this isn't a match. But it turned out so well it became a house staple. I like it with roasted tomatillo salsa and crema and a _Dos Equis_ amber.

##### Ingredients
* 3 pounds pork shoulder. Get the good stuff; the pork will taste of its fat, and cheap pork fat tastes gross.
* 2-3 medium onions or two large onions. I like yellows, but I've done sweet onions and it's rad.
* A pile of chiles.

Let's pause here for a second, 'cause there are a _lot_ of great chiles you could use. I think this is best with dried red chiles, and ambrosial if those chiles were smoked. That means chipotles, anchos, or Oaxacenos. It's difficult to give quantities on these things. It comes down to taste, hey? If you don't cook with these things often, or don't like spicy foods, use Oaxacenos -- one or maybe two total. If you like it hot, keep adding chipotles until your head explodes. I like spicy pork; I usually use 3-4 chiplotles, depending on size. If you aren't big on smoked chiles, look at a dried New Mexico red, or use fresh-ground _chiles pequenos_.

* 3-4 cloves garlic, peeled
* Salt
