Recommended braised pork belly cooking instructions can be found online [here](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/anne-burrell/crispy-mustard-braised-pork-belly-recipe.html). 

* Once the pork belly is golden, slice quarter-inch slabs of pork belly - use 2 slices per taco, or more if desired.
* Add green tomatillo salsa, fresh avocado, and onions and cilantro to garnish.
* Best in corn tortillas, but flour or wheat tortillas are also acceptible.
* Chow down!
