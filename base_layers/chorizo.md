* 500 g chorizo
* 20 g black cumin seed, ground
* 2 cloves garlic
* 15 ml white wine
* 4 g salt if wine is unsalted
* oil to coat the pan

Heat oil in the pan.

Toss in the garlic, and the chorizo on top of that.
Add the cumin. Brown the chorizo.
Use the splash of wine to loosen anything stuck to the pan.

Perfect, lightly seasoned taco meat.
