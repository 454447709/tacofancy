Veggies for Fish Tacos
======================
Fish tacos are a special breed, requiring different vegetable options.  

Assemble your veg from the following options:

-cabbage, purple, shredded
-cabbage, other shades, shredded
-radishes, sliced into thin slices
-red peppers, diced
-cherry tomatoes, sliced (if you're a heathen)
-cilantro, if it doesn't taste like soap to you

And one requirement:
-limes, sliced for juicing over tacos.

Place out your selections and assemble into your taco. Then squeeze a lime over the top.
