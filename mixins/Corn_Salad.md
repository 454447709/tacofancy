Corn Salad
===================

This is my first Github commit. I'm glad it's taco related.

* 2 ears of corn
* 1 lime, juiced
* Small handful of Cilantro, chopped
* A few green onions, chopped
* Garlic salt, or Garlic AND salt. I use Trader Joe's Garlic Salt in the grinder usually. 

Cut the corn off of the cob (is there a fancy word for that?) 
In a mixing bowl mix together corn, lime juice, chopped cilantro and garlic salt. You can tweak any of this stuff as desired, obvs.
