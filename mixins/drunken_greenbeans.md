drunken green beans
===================

Green beans are fine. Green beans cooked in beer are better. Maybe even the best

* 1 surly fistfull of greenbeans
* half a beer
* quarter cup vegetable broth
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* some salt, whatever

First peel and dice the garlic and saute it in the olive oil. Before it gets all burned and ruined, add the beer and vegetable broth. 
  
As the liquid comes to a boil, cut the greenbeans up. Or not. It's your life. But add the greenbeans and a pinch of salt and let them simmer for about five minutes â€” if you like your beans on the softer side you can let it got a little longer. But the trick is to pull them right after the color starts to turn and you've just made a delicious addition to any taco.
