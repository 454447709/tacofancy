=========

This is a community-driven taco repo. Please fork and submit your own recipes, because the more there are, the more delicious it gets. I'll probably write more here soon.

This repository contains a few different directories:

* [full tacos](/full_tacos)
    * this contains full descriptions of tacos. those tacos may contain additional elements from other directories.
* [base layers](/base_layers)
    * this is where you'll find meats, beans, tofu, and other things that make up the 'base' of your taco goodness.
* [mixins](/mixins)
    * the base is important, but what you add to it is what makes the taco glow.
* [condiments](/condiments)
    * do you make a motherfucking *salsa*? do you know how to pickle your own jalape√±os? yeah, put it here.
* [seasonings](/seasonings)
    * hot and spicy? rubs and sauces? it's all in here.
* [like_tacos](/like_tacos)
    * a collection of things that are like tacos, e.g. gua bao.

    
Community assistance in growing the number of directories, or in better organizing or whatever is more more more than welcome.

notes on writing & naming conventions
---------------------------

* For ease, please write your recipes in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and give your files the .md extension.

* If you are creating a [full taco](/full_tacos), be sure to also create the related [base layer](/base_layers) ingredient and [mixins](/mixins) that go in it. Link to those individual recipes within your [full taco](/full_tacos) to create object-oriented taco goodness.

* Please name your files with underscores_in_place_of_spaces so that links remain readable and aren't%20full%20of%20bullshit.

* Perhaps others can contribute helpful Git 101 links & tips here.

This whole thing was hastily assembled on a cold November evening with the warmth of some steak, sweet potato, and apple tacos aglow in my belly.
