Cranberry Salsa
===============

Ingredients
------------
* 1 bag cranberries
* 1 cup water
* 3/4 cup sugar
* half a small white onion
* 1 jalepeño
* 1 bunch cilantro
* 1 lime

Directions
-----------
1. In a saucepan, get your water and sugar boiling, then add the cranberries. Boil until the cranberries pop (5-10 minutes), then take off heat, drain, and cool. They'll be slightly jelly-like, but you don't want them to disintegrate entirely, so watch them closely. 

2. While the cranberries are cooling, chop your white onion, your jalepeño and cilantro. 

3. Once your berries are cool, they'll probably have turned gooey. If there is still a bunch of water, drain it. But it's probably turned to jelly. 

4. Combine everything, and give a good squeeze of lime over the whole thing. As you combine, you'll notice that the cranberries just give up their shape entirely. Also: Don't wear your finest clothing when you do this--this shit _stains_.

5. Taste it, you can add more sugar at this point if it's too tangy for you. Plus more onion, or jalepeño or cilantro. The Cilantro is your big mover here: it helps to round out the sharpness of the cranberry. Lime also helps bring down the cranberry overload.
