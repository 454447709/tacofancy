Beet Salsa
================

Tired of plain ol carne asada tacos? Get exotic with beet salsa.

* 4 - 6 Roma tomatoes
* 1 - 2 Serrano pepper
* Reasonably sized onion (green or vidalia)
* N garlic cloves (leave it up to your buds, I like 10 or more)
* Sal and pepper to taste
* 1 bunch of beets
# 1 or more lemons

Fry tomatoes, pepper(s), onion and garlic in a pan on or about medium until they are brown and tomato skins are peeling away. Move ingredients to the blender and pur√®e. Chop beets to a blendable size and add to salsa. Add salt and pepper to taste. Squeeze in desired amount of lemon and blend one more time.
