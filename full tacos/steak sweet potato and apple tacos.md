Steak, Sweet Potato and Apple Tacos
==================================

It was a cold, wet November night tonight and I wanted a good warm taco that had a little bit of a taste of fall to it. Sweet-potato is one of my go-to taco ingredients, and on a whim, I cut up an apple and added it in. OHMYGOD, that was a good move. This taco contains the following:

* [chopped steak](/base%20layers/chopped%20steak.md)
* sweet potato and apple hash
* guacamole
* tomatoes
* sour cream
* sriracha

They were really good.
